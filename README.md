## 📌 Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to strengthen my web development skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** while creating a useful tool for beginners to learn about sorting algorithms. By visualizing these algorithms, users can gain a deeper understanding of their behavior, efficiency, and the concept of algorithmic sorting.

## 📊 Supported Sorting Algorithms

This application currently supports the following sorting algorithms:

- **🔄 Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **📍 Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly picking the next item and inserting it into its correct position.
- **🔍 Selection Sort**: Repeatedly finds the minimum element and places it at the beginning of the unsorted portion.
- **⚡ Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the array into halves, sorts, and then merges them back together.
- **⚡ Quick Sort**: A highly efficient, in-place sorting algorithm that uses partitioning to sort elements.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Generate Array**: Users can generate a random array of numbers to be sorted.
2. **Select Algorithm**: Choose the desired sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3. **Adjust Speed**: Control the speed of the visualization for better observation.
4. **Sort**: Watch the chosen sorting algorithm in action as it sorts the array step-by-step.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Visuals**: Observe sorting algorithms dynamically sorting arrays with real-time animations.
- **Customizable Settings**: Change array size and sorting speed to suit your learning pace.
- **Educational Tool**: Perfect for beginners to get a visual intuition for how different sorting algorithms work.

## 📈 Benefits

- Enhances understanding of sorting algorithms through visual learning.
- Helps beginners bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.
- Provides a fun and engaging way to study algorithms.
